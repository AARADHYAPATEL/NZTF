            <h2>üåç What is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>
            <p>
                The total amount of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), that are released into the atmosphere as a result of your daily activities is known as your <strong>carbon footprint</strong>.
                Driving a car, using electricity, heating your house, purchasing clothing, and even eating food are all sources of these emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The planet pays a price for everything we do. For instance:
                <ul>
                    <li>üöó Every liter of petrol produced by a car emits about 2.3 kg of CO2.</li>
                    <li>üí° Over 250 kg of CO‚ÇÇ, or 400 kWh, can be used annually by a typical refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>üçî A single beef burger produces about 3 kg of CO‚ÇÇ.</li>
                </ul>
                Globally, the average person emits roughly <strong>4.5 metric tons of CO‚ÇÇ</strong> annually, but in developed nations, that amount can reach over 15 tons!

            <h2>üí° Why Does It Matter?</h2>
            <p>
                Greenhouse gases cause <strong>global warming</strong> and <strong>climate change</strong> by trapping heat in the atmosphere.
                Sea levels rise, wildfires increase, extreme weather events occur, and biodiversity declines as a result. This process accelerates as we emit more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good news is that minor adjustments can have a significant impact. You can actively combat climate change by monitoring and lowering your carbon footprint.

            <h2>üßÆ The Use of This Calculator</h2>
            <p>
                You can estimate the carbon footprint of your lifestyle choices with this calculator. By segmenting it into distinct domains (such as automobiles and appliances), you will:
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize the behaviors that lead to the highest emissions.</li>
                    <li>üéØ Make plans to gradually lessen your impact.</li>
                    <li>üå± Make more environmentally responsible choices.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                The first step to change is awareness. With the knowledge this tool gives you, you can take meaningful action.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Every kg of CO‚ÇÇ escaped issues.</strong> Imagine the enormous impact that would result from millions of people making tiny changes.
