Introduction
Our project is; To code and make an app that will track carbon footprints, waste management, or promote recycling awareness. In this project, the app could target different aspects of environmental responsibility, monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and promoting carbon offset programs. This also includes educating users about waste management practices and motivating them to recycle more effectively. By using real-time data collection, integrated suggestions, and user-friendly interfaces, the app would offer individuals a comprehensive way to contribute to a greener planet.
What’s the problem?
We noticed that the rapidly increasing carbon footprints and the lack of awareness and implementation of green jobs contributes greatly to global warming, climate change, and a variety of environmental issues.
Problems at hand:
Lack of Public Awareness: The issues haven’t reached the public or they haven’t been encouraged to take action efficiently.
Less implementation of Green Jobs: Green jobs focus on sustainability, renewable energy, environmental protection, and reducing environmental impact, help address these challenges. However, they are not being implemented at a high rate currently.
Increasing Carbon Footprints: Carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases, (mainly carbon dioxide), released into the atmosphere as a result of our daily activities. They contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming, extreme weather patterns, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity.
Project Objectives
Analysis Phase: Research about the current problems, possible solutions, see how effective they are.
Strategy Development: Start with code, run it a few times to test and reflect to see what we can improve on. Work on the flyers and ads for advertising the product.
Implementation Plan: Present the project at a few shops nearby, schools. etc. Make sure the code is working and we have a number of people actually using our product.
Methodology
Brainstorming Sessions: Collaborate to generate innovative ideas for the product, ads, flyers, and other promotional campaigns.
Testing and Refinement: Try out the product and strategies on a smaller scale to assess the effectiveness. Gather feedback, iterate, and refine the strategies based on initial results.

Expected Outcomes
Decrease in carbon footprint: We expect a decrease in the carbon footprints of our product users, at least on a small scale.
Increased implementation of green jobs: We expect our users or audience to be more open or encouraged towards implementing green jobs.
Increased awareness: We expect our audience to be more aware about the current world problems that may later be threatening global issues.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our project aims to empower individuals with the tools they need to monitor and reduce their carbon footprints, manage waste more effectively, and promote recycling awareness. By creating a user-friendly app that collects real-time data, offers personalized suggestions, and educates users on sustainable practices, we hope to make a meaningful impact on both individual behavior and the broader environmental landscape. As we’ve highlighted, the increasing carbon footprints and lack of widespread awareness around green jobs are contributing to global environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of biodiversity. Our app seeks to address these issues by encouraging users to take action, adopt more sustainable habits, and explore career opportunities in green sectors. We anticipate that by using our app, users will see a reduction in their carbon footprints, be more inclined to implement green job practices in their lives, and gain a deeper understanding of the pressing environmental issues facing our planet. Ultimately, our goal is to inspire a greater sense of responsibility and foster a collective effort toward building a greener, more sustainable future for all.
